# OpenAI ChatKit Advanced Samples

This repository contains a few advanced examples, which serve a complete [ChatKit](https://github.com/openai/chatkit-js) playground that pairs a FastAPI backend with a Vite + React frontend.

The top-level [**backend**](backend) and [**frontend**](frontend) directories provide a basic project template that demonstrates ChatKit UI, widgets, and client tools.

- It runs a custom ChatKit server built with [ChatKit Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/chatkit-python) and [OpenAI Agents SDK for Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python).
- Available agent tools: `get_weather` for rendering a widget, `switch_theme` and `record_fact` as client tools

The Vite server proxies all `/chatkit` traffic straight to the local FastAPI service so you can develop the client and server in tandem without extra wiring.

## Quickstart

1. Start FastAPI backend API.
2. Configure the frontend's domain key and launch the Vite app.
3. Explore the demo flow.

Each step is detailed below.

### 1. Start FastAPI backend API

From the repository root you can bootstrap the backend in one step:

```bash
npm run backend
```

This command runs `uv sync` for `backend/` and launches Uvicorn on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Make sure [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is installed and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is exported beforehand.

If you prefer running the backend from inside `backend/`, follow the manual steps:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

If you don't have uv, you can do the same with:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The development API listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Run Vite + React frontend

From the repository root you can start the frontend directly:

```bash
npm run frontend
```

This script launches Vite on `http://127.0.0.1:5170`.

To configure and run the frontend manually:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Optional configuration hooks live in [`frontend/src/lib/config.ts`](frontend/src/lib/config.ts) if you want to tweak API URLs or UI defaults.

To launch both the backend and frontend together from the repository root, you can use `npm start`. This command also requires `uv` plus the necessary environment variables (for example `OPENAI_API_KEY`) to be set beforehand.

The Vite dev server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5170`, and this works fine for local development. However, for production deployments:

1. Host the frontend on infrastructure you control behind a managed domain.
2. Register that domain on the [domain allowlist page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/security/domain-allowlist) and add it to [`frontend/vite.config.ts`](frontend/vite.config.ts) under `server.allowedHosts`.
3. Set `VITE_CHATKIT_API_DOMAIN_KEY` to the value returned by the allowlist page.

If you want to verify this remote access during development, temporarily expose the app with a tunnel (e.g. `ngrok http 5170` or `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5170`) and add that hostname to your domain allowlist before testing.

### 3. Explore the demo flow

With the app reachable locally or via a tunnel, open it in the browser and try a few interactions. The sample ChatKit UI ships with three tools that trigger visible actions in the pane:

1. **Fact Recording** - prompt: `My name is Kaz`
2. **Weather Info** - prompt: `What's the weather in San Francisco today?`
3. **Theme Switcher** - prompt: `Change the theme to dark mode` 

### Security Tools

This application also integrates several offensive security tools from the Ghost-crew toolbox. These tools can be invoked by the chatbot to perform various security-related tasks.

**Important:** Before using these tools, ensure you have the necessary system-level dependencies installed. For more information, see the `backend/README.md` file.

Here are some example prompts for using the security tools:

1.  **Nmap Scan** - prompt: `scan example.com with nmap`
2.  **SQLmap Scan** - prompt: `scan http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 with sqlmap`
3.  **FFUF Scan** - prompt: `scan http://example.com with ffuf wordlist wordlist.txt`
4.  **Metasploit Scan** - prompt: `scan example.com with metasploit module auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version`

## What's next

Under the [`examples`](examples) directory, you'll find three more sample apps that ground the starter kit in real-world scenarios:

1. [**Customer Support**](examples/customer-support): airline customer support workflow.
2. [**Knowledge Assistant**](examples/knowledge-assistant): knowledge-base agent backed by OpenAI's File Search tool.
3. [**Marketing Assets**](examples/marketing-assets): marketing creative workflow.

Each example under [`examples/`](examples) includes the helper scripts (`npm start`, `npm run frontend`, `npm run backend`) pre-configured with its dedicated ports, so you can `cd` into an example and run `npm start` to boot its backend and frontend together. Please note that when you run `npm start`, `uv` must already be installed and all required environment variables should be exported.
